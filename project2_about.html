    About
  </h2>
  <p>
    I'm just your average high school student. I love having fun, hanging out with my friends, and finding the TRUTH about what's out there. I have spent the past two weeks casually looking into this subject, and let me tell you, what I've found has shaken me to my core. You'll notice that most of this site is in morse code. That's because if the government knew what I was saying, they would shut this down! But the public deserves the truth.
